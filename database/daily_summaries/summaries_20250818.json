  "Market Volatility & Options": {
    "summary": "**Daily Market Digest: Market Volatility & Options**\n\n**Cattle Market Showcases Extreme Volatility**  \nLast week, the feeder cattle complex experienced unprecedented fluctuations, trading within a staggering $6.00 range. In stark contrast to past trends where movements were typically restrained to $1.00 or $2.00 increments, current algorithmic trading practices amplify market reactions, increasing volatility significantly. The fed cash cattle market added to this unpredictability, with Texas seeing no negotiated cattle trade, as feedlot managers held firm in their pricing stances, demanding higher offers from packers.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced the establishment of a $750 million sterile fly production facility in Texas. This facility aims to bolster protections for U.S. cattle against the New World screwworm, a notable development for the livestock sector.\n\n**Political Reverberations from the Epstein Files**  \nThe re-emergence of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation has ignited a political firestorm, impacting market volatility. Ongoing congressional investigations into Epstein's financial ties and alleged criminal activities are reshaping risk perceptions within Trump-aligned sectors. This political theater, characterized by subpoenas to high-profile figures, pressures associated industries, particularly in legal, regulatory, and reputational domains.\n\nInvestors are recalibrating strategies, focusing on sectors with heightened scrutiny. Companies heavily engaged in ESG policies could face backlash amid investigations, while banks linked to Epstein are at risk of regulatory fines. As the legal quagmire unfolds, sectors like healthcare and technology may also brace for intensified scrutiny.\n\n**Mortgage Rates Remain Stable Amid Quiet Market Conditions**  \nIn mortgage news, rates have stabilized, with the average 30-year fixed rate reaching its lowest levels since October 2024. The calm is largely attributed to a lack of volatility in the bond market, despite recent inflation data stirring the pot. As rates remain steady, this presents opportunities for homebuyers to secure favorable financing conditions.\n\n**Brazil's Lithium Market Faces Challenges**  \nOn the lithium front, Brazil has reported a significant drop in spodumene exports, plummeting 73% in the first half of the year compared to 2024. This downturn in volume correlates with a bearish market sentiment and a surplus in the supply chain, leading to notable price fluctuations in spodumene concentrate. While Brazil has bolstered its lithium production capacity, the market grapples with an oversupply and cautious demand.\n\nSignificant attention is now focused on Brazil's strategic minerals, as global interest grows amid ongoing discussions regarding potential agreements with U.S. officials. With lithium's role in battery production becoming increasingly paramount, Brazil seeks to leverage its resources to meet rising global demand.\n\n**Conclusion**  \nIn a rapidly shifting market landscape defined by volatility\u2014spanning cattle, political strife, mortgage stability, and the critical minerals sector\u2014investors are urged to remain steadfast and strategically adaptive. As new challenges emerge, maintaining a vigilant approach toward risk management and market developments will be essential.",

        "article_text": "For those of you who were busy last week, let me share with you some of the glass balls the market was juggling while you were away. For starters, it's wild to realize the feeder cattle complex traded within a $6.00 window last week. It feels like the market gives and takes in wild increments right now -- because it does! The days of seeing $1.00 higher or maybe just $2.00 higher or lower is not the current state of the industry. Algorithmic trading is quick to send signals to overdo any move, and anyone even slightly invested in the cattle complex knows that, given the sheet price point of the marketplace, volatility is a bigger issue than potentially anything else.\n\nSecondly, the fed cash cattle market was a wild card as well, as there were no negotiated cattle traded last week in Texas at the submission time for USDA's reporting. Simply put, feedlot managers dug their heels into the ground and said they weren't going to trade cattle unless packers upped their ante -- and by golly, they didn't. I think it's utterly incredible, and I have so much respect for those managers who have elected to stay engaged in the marketplace despite prices being historically high, so they can say they squeezed every dollar out of the market that it had to offer week in and week out.\n\nAnd last, but not least, throughout the week we knew U.S. Ag Secretary Brooke Rollins was going to have a big announcement Friday afternoon regarding New World screwworm, but didn't have any of the details until her announcement late in the week. Some were worried the announcement was going to consist of a date for allowing Mexican cattle to be imported into the U.S. again. However, thankfully, that wasn't mentioned at all. Instead, Rollins shared that a $750 million domestic sterile fly production facility was going to be established in Texas to help protect U.S. cattle from the infectious parasite. DTN's Senior Livestock Editor Jennifer Carrico wrote in length about the announcement here: https://www.dtnpf.com/\u2026.\n\nSo, if you feel tracking the cattle complex has been a bit much lately, I'm here to tell you that's because it has been! Even though prices are historically high, the market has been dealing with incredible pressure as it weighs the technical, fundamental and outside factors of the world. But even so, it's our job to keep engaged so we can make the best financial decisions possible for our businesses. Carry on friends, there's a new week ahead of us and new hurdles to conquer!\n\nShayLe Stewart can be reached at shayle.stewart@dtn.com\n\n(c) Copyright 2025 DTN, LLC. All rights reserved.",

        "article_text": "The Jeffrey Epstein files saga, once a shadowy footnote in the 2016 election, has resurged in 2025 as a seismic force reshaping political risk and market volatility. Congressional investigations into Epstein's financial networks, government complicity, and ties to powerful figures have exposed vulnerabilities in Trump-aligned assets and sectors. For investors, the intersection of partisan clashes, legal battles, and institutional scrutiny demands a recalibration of risk management strategies.\n\nThe Political Firestorm: From Grand Juries to Congressional Showdowns\n\nThe House Oversight Committee's bipartisan probe into Epstein's 2007 non-prosecution agreement and the Biden administration's handling of the case has become a proxy war for broader ideological battles. With subpoenas issued to former Attorney General William Barr, the Clintons, and even the Justice Department itself, the investigation has transcended a criminal inquiry to become a political theater.\n\nThe Trump administration's inconsistent stance\u2014publicly vowing transparency while facing legal pushback from federal judges\u2014has created a vacuum of trust. A federal judge's recent denial of the DOJ's request to unseal grand jury records, coupled with a lawsuit from Democracy Forward seeking Epstein-Trump communications, underscores the legal quagmire. For investors, this uncertainty translates to heightened volatility in sectors where Trump-aligned entities hold sway.\n\nSectors at Risk: Legal, Reputational, and Regulatory Exposure\n\nESG and DEI Policies: Companies with aggressive ESG initiatives face scrutiny as Congress and state attorneys general align on antitrust and corporate governance issues. The backlash against \u201cwoke capitalism\u201d has already led to shareholder lawsuits, and Epstein-related investigations could amplify this trend. Privacy and Cybersecurity: Financial institutions like Bank of America and JP Morgan, flagged for delayed reporting of Epstein's suspicious transactions, now face regulatory fines and reputational damage. The Federal Reserve's recent stress tests highlight the fragility of banks under political fire. China and National Security: Trump-aligned companies with Chinese partnerships, such as those in tech or manufacturing, risk exposure if investigations uncover Epstein-linked financial flows through sanctioned Russian banks. Antitrust and Market Power: The DOJ's renewed focus on corporate monopolies, spurred by bipartisan outrage over Epstein's network, could target industries like healthcare and tech\u2014sectors where Trump allies hold significant influence. Government Contracts: Firms with federal ties, including defense contractors, face audits over spending and compliance. The bipartisan push for accountability in Epstein-related spending could lead to contract cancellations or penalties.\n\nCase Study: Leon Black and the $170M Question\n\nSenator Ron Wyden's investigation into Leon Black's $170 million payment to Epstein\u2014a transaction lacking a written contract\u2014exemplifies the financial entanglements under scrutiny. Black's immunity deal in the U.S. Virgin Islands, which allowed Epstein to fund operations there, has drawn comparisons to Trump's Mar-a-Lago connections. While Black's SponsorsForGood, a Trump-aligned charity, remains unscathed, the ripple effects on related sectors are palpable.\n\nInvestment Strategies: Navigating the Storm\n\nHedge Against Legal Volatility: Investors should consider short-term options or inverse ETFs in sectors facing subpoenas. For example, the iShares U.S. Financials ETF (IYF) has shown sensitivity to regulatory news. Diversify Away from Politically Sensitive Sectors: Reduce exposure to banks with Epstein ties (e.g., Bank of America) and prioritize sectors with lower political risk, such as utilities or consumer staples. Monitor Bipartisan Legislation: The House's H.Res.589, which mandates the release of Epstein-related records, could trigger market swings. Track legislative timelines and prepare for liquidity shifts. Leverage Short-Term Opportunities: Volatility in Trump-aligned stocks, such as those in the S&P 500's energy or industrials sectors, may create buying opportunities if investigations conclude without major revelations.\n\nConclusion: The Long Game in a Short-Term Crisis\n\nThe Epstein files investigations are not merely about past misdeeds; they are a litmus test for institutional integrity and political resilience. For investors, the key lies in distinguishing between transient noise and enduring risk. While Trump-aligned assets face near-term turbulence, the long-term outlook depends on the resolution of these inquiries and the broader reforms they may catalyze. In a market where political risk is now a quantifiable variable, adaptability\u2014and a dash of contrarian insight\u2014will separate winners from losers.",

        "article_text": "Mortgage Rates Mostly Steady Despite Some Market Volatility\n\nMortgage rates hit fresh long term lows yesterday with the average top tier 30yr fixed rate at the best levels since October 3rd, 2024. There wasn't anything exceptional about the movement yesterday or on any other day in the past week. Rather, it was the jobs report at the beginning of the month that accounted for a 2-day rally. Rates have been holding near longer-term lows with little fanfare ever since.\n\nBecause mortgage rates are based on bonds, the absence of fanfare reflects an absence of volatility in the underlying bond market. Today presented the biggest threat to that calm trend since the August 1st jobs report. Unlike the jobs report, today's inflation data caused a volatile reaction in an unfriendly direction.\n\nIn other words, the economic data put upward pressure on rates. The catch is that rates were set to start the day at even lower levels before the data came out. The net effect is another day of fairly minimal change.",

        "article_text": "Brazil's total lithium spodumene exports fell 73% in volume during the first half of the year compared to the same period in 2024 amid bearish market sentiment that reduced global negotiations, according to data from the Secretariat of Foreign Trade of the Brazilian Ministry of Development, Industry, Trade and Services.\n\nBetween January and June, Brazil exported 41,746 mt of spodumene, a mineral used primarily as a source of lithium. The number represents a decrease of 118,509 mt compared to the same period in 2024, which recorded 160,256 mt.\n\nIn terms of revenue, the decline represents a drop of $123 million to $24 million in H1 2025, compared to $147 million from January to June 2024.\n\nCurrently, three companies produce spodumene in the country: CBL, AMG and Sigma Lithium. The latter alone accounts for nearly 70% of the market share.\n\nSeveral market participants have reported a different rhythm for Sigma to close transactions in 2025. Some cited changes in the quality of the material, while others indicate that the company is offering small quantities of spodumene, anticipating higher prices for the commodity.\n\n\"Export shipments to date may not match precisely production dates, as a result of pricing asymmetries, which are now beginning to be self-corrected by market participants,\" Daniel Abdo, vice president of international relations at Sigma Lithium told S&P Global Commodity Insights.\n\nThe company also highlighted a 32% increase in production in 2025 amid an adaptation of its commercial strategy to match the seasonality and volatility of lithium market prices, following the lead of other global lithium producers.\n\n\"In addition to our ethical sustainability production standards, Sigma's lithium oxide is unique globally for its high technical qualities and is very sought after by the global leaders of the EV supply chain,\" Abdo concluded.\n\nVinicius Alvarenga, CEO of CBL, told S&P Global Commodity Insights that the company has not undergone any operational changes in the past few months and that they have been operating at full capacity both in mining and refining.\n\n\"We remain very confident in the long term, as lithium continues to show great potential for demand growth,\" he said.\n\nMarket surplus, weak demand\n\nThe lithium market is currently facing challenges due to a surplus and slower-than-expected demand. However, over the past month, it has shown an uptrend driven by the gain in the GFE futures contract, mostly due to supply-side disruptions, as the world's largest battery maker CATL has suspended mining.\n\nPrices for spodumene concentrate 6% FOB Australia have plummeted from peak levels of around $8,000/mt in November 2022 to over $900/mt in recent assessments.\n\nThe lowest level recorded in 2025 was in June when the assessment registered $575/mt. In recent weeks, a strong recovery has pushed the levels up to $985/mt Aug. 15, matching the same level as June of last year.\n\nThe recent price levels recorded highlight the importance of production costs, which in Brazil range between $400 and $500/mt -- contrasting sharply with other countries, where costs generally exceed $700/mt.\n\nPlatts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, assessed lithium spodumene 5.5-6.0% FOB Brazil at $900/mt Aug. 14, stable on the day and at a $100 increase since its launch March 24.\n\nOngoing production\n\nBrazil is the world's sixth-largest lithium producer, trailing behind countries such as Australia, Chile and China, according to the US Geological Survey.\n\nIn 2024, nearly all of Brazil's lithium production was exported to China, accounting for approximately 99% of the total exports, as reported by the Ministry of Development, Industry, Trade and Services. Smaller quantities of the material were sent to countries like Japan, Germany and the US.\n\nBrazil significantly increased its lithium production in 2024, achieving 49,844 mt of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE), nearly double the 29,457 mt produced in 2023, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nThis surge in production is part of a broader trend, with Brazil's lithium output steadily rising despite the decrease in exports in H1. The country is also attracting significant investment aimed at expanding its lithium production capacity.\n\nFocus on critical minerals\n\nBrazil's presence on the map of strategic minerals has increasingly drawn attention from governments and companies worldwide. Lithium, niobium, graphite and rare earth elements -- used in the production of batteries, electronic equipment and military gear -- are at the center of these discussions.\n\nIn July, US representative Gabriel Escobar met with representatives of the Brazilian Mining Institute (IBRAM) in Brasilia to discuss the US' interest in potential agreements with the Brazilian mineral sector, according to the institute.",

The talk could shed light on how the Fed chief is thinking about the central bank's battle to bring down inflation, and whether he thinks the Fed is ready to cut its benchmark fed funds rate from its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%, a level he and other Fed officials consider high enough to \"moderately\" weigh on economic growth and put downward pressure on inflation. Jerome Powell at last year's Jackson Hole gathering. Natalie Behring / Bloomberg / Getty Images In recent years, Powell has used the annual Jackson Hole speech to signal major changes in monetary policy. In 2024, he confirmed the Fed was about to cut rates for the first time in more than a year, after holding the Fed funds rate high to stamp out a post-pandemic wave of inflation. This time, Powell could use the summit to signal whether the Fed is ready to resume rate cuts for the first time since December.\n\n\n\nPowell may also shed light on how he views the Fed's current dilemma. The central bank is tasked with using monetary policy to keep inflation low and employment high. But lately, both of those economic indicators have gone in the wrong direction after President Donald Trump launched his unprecedented campaign to raise import taxes.\n\n\n\nExperts expect the speech to go one of at least three ways.

Two big home improvement retailers could offer clues about that this week. Homeowners renovating kitchens and retiling bathrooms have long been crucial parts of the business at Home Depot (HD) and Lowe\u2019s (LOW). These customers have the means to fund large projects\u2014but, in recent years, have been trying to wait out high interest rates, Home Depot CEO Edward \"Ted\" Decker said in April. This spring, he said, some changed their minds, deciding interest rates are likely to remain elevated, and waiting was unlikely to reduce the cost of borrowing. We may get a better sense of how their thinking has evolved on Tuesday, when Home Depot is slated to release its second-quarter results, and Wednesday, when Lowe\u2019s is scheduled to post its numbers. The updates come as economists speculate that the central bank may lower interest rates in September. Higher prices and surges in inflation are unlikely to destabilize Home Depot's core customer: homeowners who earn an average of $110,000 annually, Decker said while discussing the company's first-quarter results on a conference call in May. \u201cOur customer, from a broad basis, is one of the strongest in the economy,\u201d he said, according to a transcript made available by AlphaSense. \"We've talked about how much home price appreciation they've seen over the past year. Stock markets have recovered, job and wage growth are strong.\u201d Higher interest rates \u201ccreated a deferral mindset,\u201d CFO Richard McPhail said in April. That\u2019s led to an estimated $50 billion drop-off in home improvement spending in recent years, according to comments from both companies' leaders. There are signs that those deferrals may continue. Just over a quarter of Americans surveyed in August said they expect to spend more on home improvement in the coming three months, down from more than 30% a year earlier, according to Bank of America research. Home Depot and Lowe's each reported year-over-year declines in comparable store sales in the first quarter, though the former said \"big-ticket\" transactions worth $1,000 or more rose 0.3%. Appliance sales were brisk, but purchases for remodeling jobs\u2014the type that may require financing or borrowing against one\u2019s home equity\u2014remained soft, executives said. Foot traffic fell year-over-year at both chains during the second quarter, but improved over the course of the period, according to Placer.ai, a visit-tracking group. Analysts think both companies will report a 1.1% year-over-year increase in comparable store sales, according to consensus estimates from Visible Alpha. Analysts estimate Home Depot will report $45.3 billion in sales, up from the $43.2 billion brought in the same quarter last year, according to Visible Alpha. They're looking for $6.8 billion in adjusted earnings\u2014a bit more than the $6.6 billion reported last year. Lowe's is forecast to report $24 billion in sales, a tick above the $23.6 billion reported last year, according to Visible Alpha. Wall Street is anticipating $3.5 billion in adjusted earnings, compared with the $3.4 billion reported a year earlier. Home Depot shares closed about 1% lower on Monday, while Lowe's stock slipped 0.5%. Shares of Home Depot and Lowe's have gained less than 2% since the start of the year, lagging the performance of the S&P 500. TradingView -Sarina Trangle\n\nWhy Solar Stocks Are Surging Today Solar stocks are surging after the Treasury Department released guidance on the kind of projects that can qualify for clean energy tax credits that was less restrictive than investors feared. Shares of First Solar (FSLR) were up about 10% in recent trading, making it the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 Monday behind Dayforce. Sunrun (RUN) shares jumped 9%, while Enphase Energy (ENPH) and SolarEdge (SEDG) each added about 4%. Shares of First Solar, SolarEdge and Sunrun have posted big gains so far in 2025, while Enphase stock has lost nearly half its value this year. TradingView The \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" signed by President Donald Trump last month is set to phase out tax credits for new wind and solar projects unless they begin construction by July 4, 2026, and Friday's guidelines narrow how projects started on or after Sept. 2 can qualify. Before, developers could claim tax credits as long as they had spent at least 5% of the project cost and could finish construction in four years. The latest guidance eliminates that 5% \"safe harbor\" rule for larger projects, but preserves it for smaller ones like rooftop installations. Big projects can still qualify, however, if \"physical work of a significant nature\" is undertaken. \"After weeks of speculation and market coalition around a higher hurdle on both the 5% rule + physical work rule, today's guidance was surprisingly light on changes,\" Jefferies analysts wrote Friday, and called it a \"clear win\" for residential solar. \"Many were anticipating a 'worst case' scenario including retroactivity to as early as Jan. 1st and even the continuity [safe harbor] window narrowing from 4-years to 2.5-years.\" Citi called Friday's guidance \u201cbetter than anticipated,\u201d as it wasn\u2019t retroactive like some investors had feared. There had also been concerns that the 5% investment requirement would be raised to more than 10% to qualify, they wrote. -Nisha Gopalan\n\nHow Much Traders Expect Walmart to Move After Earnings Retail giant Walmart (WMT) is slated to report second-quarter earnings before markets open on Thursday, and investors see potential for shares to approach a record high in the days following. Walmart stock is expected to finish the week roughly 4% above or below last week\u2019s closing price, according to options prices. A move of that magnitude would put shares at either $104, their highest close since February, or $96, a nearly 1-month low. Walmart stock has notched an average post-earnings move of about 4.2% over the past four quarters. Shares slid 0.5% after Walmart\u2019s most recent report in May, when CEO Doug McMillon warned that tariffs would drive up prices. And the stock slid 6.5% after the company\u2019s February report, when its full-year sales and earnings forecasts fell short of Wall Street estimates. Shares advanced after its two prior reports. Walmart stock is up about 11% since the start of the year after rebounding from a tariff-fueled slump throughout March and early April. Investors will be looking to Walmart for clues about how consumers and retailers are responding to President Trump\u2019s tariffs. After a slump in consumer spending this spring, retail sales upticks of 0.9% in June and 0.5% in July \u201csuggest the consumer is on slightly firmer footing headed into Q3,\u201d according to Wells Fargo economists Tim Quinlan and Shannon Grein. Nonetheless, \u201cwe are still cautious on the trajectory of spending in the second half amid a moderating jobs market and concerns over higher prices.\u201d Walmart, a Dow Jones Industrial Average component, has outpaced the performance of the blue-chip index so far in 2025.

The Denmark-based firm reported the FDA said Wegovy could be used for adults suffering from noncirrhotic metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, or MASH, who have moderate to advanced liver fibrosis, along with eating less and exercising more. Novo Nordisk Chief Scientific Officer Martin Holst Lange noted that the decision means Wegovy is the only GLP-1 obesity medicine that has received regulatory approval to treat MASH. He explained that one in three overweight or obese people suffer from it, with some 22 million Americans among them. He added that Wegovy not only stopped the disease activity, it also reversed liver damage. The company announced that Wegovy would be available immediately in the U.S. for the treatment of MASH. Dhiraj Singh / Bloomberg / Getty Images The approval is welcome news to Novo Nordisk investors, who have seen the U.S.-listed shares slump as competition from others in the weight-loss category has siphoned away sales of Wegovy. U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk were up more than 4% in recent premarket trading. At the close of trading Friday, the shares were down nearly 40% year-to-date. -Bill McColl",

    "summary": "**Macroeconomics Daily Digest**\n\nIn today's macroeconomic insights, we reflect on pivotal research and evolving trends that shape the economic landscape.\n\n**Phelps' Groundbreaking Insights**  \nStarting in the late 1960s, economist Edmund Phelps challenged the conventional belief that unemployment and inflation were inversely related. His groundbreaking work highlighted that while expansionary policies can temporarily reduce unemployment, they fail to address long-term employment stability. Phelps argued that unemployment is inherently natural in a balanced economy, achieved only when the job market reaches its natural rate.\n\n**NBER Macroeconomics Annual Highlights**  \nRecent findings from the NBER Macro Annual reveal critical examinations of current economic challenges. Researchers explored how effective bankruptcy institutions can mitigate economic downturns during credit crunches. They also analyzed U.S. monetary policy's global implications, revealing that tighter policies disproportionately affect emerging markets compared to advanced economies. Additionally, inflation dynamics are increasingly linked to supply shocks and expectations, underscoring the complexities of inflation management.\n\n**Crypto as a Core Financial Asset**  \nThe cryptocurrency market has transitioned into a key component of global finance over the past two years, heavily influenced by macroeconomic signals and institutional investment strategies. Central bank actions, particularly from the U.S. Federal Reserve, are now critical determinants of crypto valuations. Surprisingly, rising interest rates have shown a positive correlation with demand for Bitcoin, contradicting traditional financial theory.\n\n**Institutional Involvement Reshapes Crypto Cycles**  \nThe approval of Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024 has catalyzed significant institutional investment in cryptocurrency, pushing Bitcoin prices to new heights. As institutions adopt long-term strategies, crypto's volatility is dampened, evidenced by more stable correction levels compared to past cycles.\n\n**Investment Strategies in a Macro-driven Landscape**  \nFor investors in this evolving crypto market, focus on central bank indicators and consider using ETFs for exposure. Diversifying with stablecoins while maintaining long-term investments in Bitcoin may be prudent strategies, especially amid regulatory and economic clarity.\n\n**Brazil's Economic Developments**  \nIn Brazil, the Ibovespa index has shown resilience, hovering around 137,000 amidst economic data releases and stalled trade negotiations with the U.S. Key corporate stocks have fluctuated, reflecting broader market trends and investor sentiment as Finance Minister Fernando Haddad cautions about potential trade declines.\n\n**Macroframework Foundations Tool (MFT)**  \nLastly, the IMF\u2019s Macroframework Foundations Tool (MFT) presents a simplified yet robust method for macroeconomic forecasting. This tool emphasizes behavioral equations and feedback loops, providing a comprehensive approach to economic projections. Although it requires customization for specific national contexts, it represents a significant advancement in macroeconomic analysis.\n\nStay tuned for ongoing developments in macroeconomic policies and their far-reaching effects on global markets.",

        "article_text": "In the late 1960s Phelps began his prizewinning work, which challenged a long-held assumption that high levels of unemployment corresponded with low levels of inflation, and vice versa. Policy makers had assumed that expansionary fiscal and monetary policies (policies that expanded demand) could contain unemployment levels. While this policy approach can influence short-term fluctuations in employment, it does not affect the long-term employment rate. Phelps observed that price- and wage-setting behaviour is based on expectations of future conditions. He demonstrated that workers will demand higher wages when costs of living (and therefore inflation) exceed their expectations. He further proved that inflation will be contained only after employment levels reach an equilibrium point. In fact, Phelps showed that unemployment is a natural part of a balanced economy: equilibrium is achieved when the economy reaches its natural rate of unemployment.",

        "article_text": "The cryptocurrency market is no longer a fringe asset class. Over the past two years, it has evolved into a core component of global financial systems, with its valuation increasingly dictated by macroeconomic policy signals and institutional investor behavior. From the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions to the strategic accumulation of Bitcoin by hedge funds and ETFs, the forces shaping crypto markets now mirror those of traditional finance. This article explores how these dynamics are redefining digital asset cycles and offers insights for investors navigating this rapidly shifting landscape.\n\nMacroeconomic Policy: The New Market Compass\n\nCentral bank actions have emerged as a primary driver of crypto valuations. The U.S. monetary base (BOGMBASE), for instance, has shown a strong positive correlation with Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. As the Fed expanded liquidity through quantitative easing, investors flocked to high-risk assets like crypto to hedge against inflation and currency depreciation. This trend was amplified in 2024\u20132025, when the Fed's delayed rate cuts and accommodative policies fueled speculative demand.\n\nHowever, the relationship between interest rates and crypto is nuanced. While traditional portfolio theory suggests higher real interest rates (RIR) would reduce demand for non-yielding assets like Bitcoin, empirical data reveals a counterintuitive positive link. This anomaly may stem from market expectations of future monetary easing or the perception of crypto as a diversification tool even in tighter policy environments. Meanwhile, the U.S. Dollar-Euro (EXUSEU) exchange rate has also played a critical role: a stronger euro often correlates with higher Bitcoin prices, as investors seek to hedge against dollar volatility.\n\nInstitutional Investors: Architects of the New Cycle\n\nInstitutional behavior has further disrupted traditional crypto market cycles. The approval of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024 marked a turning point, enabling large-scale capital inflows without direct crypto ownership. This led to Bitcoin reaching an all-time high of $73,000 in March 2024\u2014just before the halving event\u2014effectively front-loading price discovery and upending the four-year cycle model.\n\nInstitutions have also adopted a long-term, strategic approach. Mid-tier holders (100\u20131,000 BTC) increased their share of total supply from 22.9% to 23.07% between January and April 2025, accumulating during price dips. Meanwhile, major players like MicroStrategy and BlackRock continued to build reserves, with MicroStrategy alone purchasing $1.1 billion in Bitcoin in Q1 2025. Regulatory clarity, including the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's authorization for banks to custody crypto, further solidified institutional confidence.\n\nMarket Integration and Correlation\n\nCryptocurrencies are no longer isolated from traditional markets. The correlation between Bitcoin and equities has risen sharply, particularly during periods of macroeconomic stress. For example, during the 2020 pandemic and the 2022\u20132025 volatility, Bitcoin and the S&P 500 moved in tandem, reflecting shared risk-off sentiment. This integration has made crypto more sensitive to macroeconomic indicators like inflation and interest rates, reducing its role as a standalone speculative asset.\n\nMoreover, institutional demand has tempered volatility. While Bitcoin historically experienced 70\u201380% corrections post-peak, the current cycle has seen corrections capped at 26\u201330%. This resilience stems from institutional long-term holdings and reduced exchange-based liquidity, which act as buffers against sharp sell-offs.\n\nInvestment Implications\n\nFor investors, the key takeaway is clear: crypto is now a macro-driven asset class. Here's how to position your portfolio:\n\nMonitor Central Bank Signals: Track Fed rate projections and monetary base expansions. A dovish Fed likely supports crypto prices, while tightening could trigger short-term volatility. Leverage ETFs for Exposure: Bitcoin ETFs offer regulated, liquid access to institutional-grade crypto holdings. Prioritize providers with strong inflow trends, such as BlackRock or Grayscale Mini. Diversify with Stablecoins Cautiously: While stablecoins like Tether are less responsive to macroeconomic shifts, they remain useful for transactional purposes. Avoid overexposure during inflationary periods. Adopt a Long-Term Lens: Institutions are buying during dips. Investors should consider dollar-cost averaging into Bitcoin, especially during periods of regulatory clarity and macroeconomic stability.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe crypto market's strategic retreat from speculative chaos to institutional maturity is reshaping its valuation dynamics. Macroeconomic signals and institutional behavior now act as twin engines driving price action, rendering traditional cycles obsolete. For investors, this means embracing a macro-aware, long-term strategy that aligns with the evolving role of digital assets in global portfolios. As central banks and institutions continue to redefine the crypto landscape, adaptability will be the key to unlocking value in this new era.",

MFT 1.0 is the basic version of the MFT while the tool is being further developed to incorporate more features. The structure of the MFT is based on the standard four-sector framework of the Financial Programming and Policies (FPP) developed and used by IMF staff, but it is simplified by adopting greater sectoral aggregation and requiring less data. Different from the standard accounting-based FPP framework, the MFT uses behavioral equations for generating projections and incorporates explicit feedback loops between variables across sectors. The MFT is a simple but powerful tool to produce consistent macroeconomic projections from accounting and economic perspectives, and it could be extended to incorporate a longer projection horizon, greater sectoral details, and different policy environment. The MFT is not a ready-to-use tool because it needs to be built and customized to a specific country, and this User Manual and the accompanying Excel template could guide that process.",

    "summary": "**Daily News Digest: Regulatory & Compliance Updates**\n\n*October 2023*\n\nIn current regulatory and compliance news, a notable focus is emerging on environmental protections under the Clean Water Act. A particular request from major tech players, including Meta and the Data Center Coalition, is advocating for data centers to be exempted from the exhaustive 404 permitting process required for projects near federally protected waterways. This exemption could significantly streamline the construction of data facilities, which typically demand lengthy and costly approvals.\n\nTurning to Australia, Treasurer Jim Chalmers is set to lead a significant economic roundtable aimed at laying out clear reform directions across various priorities. The three-day summit, which also sees Prime Minister Anthony Albanese participating, is a platform for fostering collaboration on economic reforms. Chalmers emphasized the need for concrete ideas and actionable plans that focus on economic growth and productivity, a sentiment echoed by Danielle Wood of the Productivity Commission, who insists on a \"growth mindset\" for Australia's policy landscape.\n\nMeanwhile, in the realm of sustainability regulation, concerns are rising over a retreat in regulatory frameworks across the U.S. and the EU. Recent trends indicate a scaling back on ambitious sustainability mandates, leading to confusion among businesses that are expected to self-regulate without clear guidance. While a vast majority of U.S. companies maintain or increase investments in sustainability, they face challenges as regulatory consistency dwindles. Critics warn that self-regulation without robust oversight fails to deliver meaningful impact, relying instead on uncoordinated voluntary efforts that may not yield significant results.\n\nThe call for \"smart regulations\" that encourage genuine sustainability initiatives while minimizing bureaucratic burdens is gaining traction. These regulations would provide flexible guidelines, reward tangible outcomes, and recognize innovative practices without drowning businesses in unnecessary compliance work. As the regulatory landscape continues to shift, the collaboration between policymakers and businesses will be crucial in fostering a resilient and effective sustainability agenda.\n\nAs we move forward, businesses are urged to continue pursuing their sustainability targets while advocating for clarity and support from regulatory frameworks, ensuring they can tackle today\u2019s challenges effectively.",

These are:\n\nclear reform directions \u2013 areas where there\u2019s momentum and broad agreement on the direction of travel even if unanimity isn\u2019t there yet\n\nspecific reforms \u2013 the handful of changes we could all agree on now\n\nongoing priorities \u2013 where there\u2019s appetite in the room for further work.\n\nChalmers says this is a three-day opportunity to inform three budgets and beyond.

So, we\u2019re not saying people aren\u2019t allowed to raise things, we\u2019re saying raise whatever you like. We\u2019ll have that debate not just in the room, but importantly out there as well,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are open to engagement and that is how you bring people with you as well on that journey of reform. You don\u2019t just spring things.

Regulate with growth in mind\n\n\u201cLeadership from the top\u201d was needed \u201cwhen the policy sausage is being made\u201d.\n\n\u201cMinisters should always weigh up the impacts of new policies on economic growth and productivity,\u201d she said. The commission recommended government put out a clear statement of intent to this effect, backed with upfront regulatory reform.\n\n\u201cGovernment must bake in the process of asking themselves, \u2018What have you done for growth today?\u2019\u201d. (This is a reference to a sign used at the time by the United States Commerce Department that reflected President John Kennedy\u2019s focus on economic renewal.)\n\n2. Real growth comes from new ideas and technology\n\n\u201cA growth mindset means fostering ways for Australia to benefit from a combination of our own innovations and using \u2013 or building on \u2013 the inventiveness of others,\u201d Wood said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why the PC favours policy and regulatory approaches that focus on outcomes \u2013 for example relying more on consumer outcomes in privacy regulations and avoiding technology-specific laws on AI.\u201d\n\n3. Productivity is a game of (many) inches\n\n\u201cThere is simply no single policy reform that can bring productivity growth back to its long term average of 1.6%,\u201d Wood said.\n\n\u201cTo shift the dial, governments will have to make a lot of pro-productivity decisions.\u201d\n\nUnlike cynics about the roundtable, for Wood the whole exercise is like \u201cChristmas, the grand finale of MasterChef and the Productivity Commission\u2019s 2024 table tennis victory over treasury, all combined,\n\n\"I\u2019m thrilled by the new appetite for economic reform that the roundtable has created over the past two months.\n\n\"And by the treasurer\u2019s elevation of productivity as \u2018the primary focus\u2019 of the government.\u201d\n\nWood has surely already won the prize for the best metaphor for Australia\u2019s regulatory mess. \u201cRegulatory hairballs have found their way into almost every corner of the economy\u201d, she said.",

This trend could undermine the sustainability progress made in the past five years.\n\nA recent survey found that 87% of U.S. companies have maintained or increased their investment in sustainability efforts this year, despite regulatory uncertainty. This suggests companies are staying the course on climate commitments and attempting to meet a wide range of reporting requirements. But regulators must fill the policy vacuum with smart regulations that reward companies who invest in taking action that positively impacts people and the planet.\n\nRegulation is retreating, and businesses are paying the price\n\nRegulations are on thin ice globally. In the U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission, steered by Republican leadership, has walked back proposed ESG and climate disclosure rules in an effort to distance itself from rulemaking promulgated under the previous administration.\n\nMeanwhile in the EU, regulators are proposing to dial back what was once the most ambitious sustainability policy agenda in the world. Policymakers have proposed scaling back key provisions of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive. Even recent proposed reforms to the EU\u2019s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism may weaken accountability, despite claims of simplification. Regulatory debate is still shifting but the direction is clear \u2014 less burdensome requirements are best.\n\nThe assumption that companies will simply fill the gap on their own is wishful thinking.\n\nThis policy pullback is creating confusion and fragmentation. Companies are stuck trying to guess what will stick and what will change. But without consistent rules, meeting those expectations has become more complex and costly.\n\nSelf-regulation doesn\u2019t deliver real impact\n\nThe idea that voluntary efforts alone will drive meaningful sustainability progress doesn\u2019t hold up. History shows that self-regulation moves too slowly and often ends in isolated success stories rather than systemic change. At best, it rewards companies already ahead. At worst, it creates the illusion of progress while the real risks go unaddressed.\n\nFor example, in the United Kingdom, The Joint Committee on Human Rights found that goods being produced using forced labor are still being sold to consumers, an indication that voluntary supply chain due diligence is falling short.\n\nEven the most committed leaders can\u2019t do this alone. Companies need fair, consistent rules that reward serious investment \u2014 and protect them from being undercut by competitors cutting corners. Without that structure, sustainability becomes a race to the bottom, not a path to resilience.\n\nBad regulation is just as harmful as no regulation\n\nThe biggest problem sustainability leaders face today is that too many mandates are focused only on compliance, not sustainable outcomes. These mandates treat every business the same, regardless of their individual progress or maturity. Such regulations also ignore innovations already in use and drown teams in redundant reporting, offering little clarity or reward.\n\nThese rules don\u2019t support change. They stall it.\n\nEven well-intentioned companies are hitting a wall. In fact, only 13% of companies are on track to comply with deadlines across four major regulations: the EU\u2019s CSRD and CBAM, California\u2019s Senate Bill 253 or the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act, and Canada\u2019s Modern Slavery Act.\n\nWhen effort goes unrecognized and penalties keep stacking up, going above and beyond for net-zero and decarbonization goals stops making business sense. The focus shifts from impact to survival, and momentum halts.\n\nFix the system, not the standards\n\nThe answer is adoption of smarter regulations across jurisdictions.\n\nSmart rules raise the bar on sustainability expectations, but they also make it easier to comply. They align incentives, respect innovation, and reflect how modern businesses operate.\n\nFor instance, companies using artificial intelligence to track emissions, monitor supply chains and identify key risks in line with regulatory requirements shouldn\u2019t be buried in paperwork. They should be recognized and rewarded. Frameworks should integrate with the AI tools companies already use. Policies should flex to fit companies at different stages of maturity.\n\nSmarter regulations means mandates that:\n\nReward measurable outcomes, not just check-box compliance.\n\nRecognize innovation, especially tools that improve transparency and efficiency.\n\nOffer flexibility, based on company size, structure, and resources.\n\nStreamline reporting, by aligning frameworks and eliminating redundancy.\n\nCompanies aren\u2019t asking for less scrutiny from regulators. They\u2019re asking for rules that make sense, and that help them focus on real results.\n\nCompanies are still leading, but they can\u2019t go it alone\n\nDespite the political noise, many companies haven\u2019t backed away from complying with sustainability regulations. They\u2019ve simply stopped broadcasting it. In fact, nearly one-third of executives surveyed by EcoVadis said they are increasing business sustainability investments but reducing public communications.\n\nAn additional 8% said they\u2019ve stopped talking about their commitments publicly but continue to invest and stay on-plan. Sustainability efforts continue behind the scenes through supplier engagement, emissions tracking, and investments in technology that support long-term goals.\n\nBut even the most advanced companies can\u2019t carry the weight alone forever. Without smart, consistent policy, the system will eventually break under its own complexity.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about optics. It\u2019s about operations. Sustainability remains a critical strategy for managing risk, staying competitive, and keeping supply chains resilient. But when the rules are unclear or constantly shifting, momentum slows, and trust erodes.",

  "Alternative Assets & Innovation": {
    "summary": "**Daily Digest: Exploring Alternative Assets & Innovation in Retirement Investments**\n\nIn a recent move, President Trump's executive order aims to expand access to alternative assets for 401(k) investors, potentially shaking up the traditional retirement investment landscape. The order, titled \"Democratizing Access to Alternative Assets for 401(k) Investors,\u201d allows company retirement plans to include options for investing in diverse asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, private equity, real estate, and commodities. This initiative recognizes that while affluent investors have long enjoyed these opportunities, many average Americans lack similar access.\n\nHowever, experts raise concerns about this expanded market, noting that many alternative investments may not be suitable for the typical 401(k) participant. As Dr. Jim Dahle of the White Coat Investor highlights, most Americans are better off investing their retirement savings in traditional, straightforward index funds rather than delving into the more complex world of alternative assets. The article warns against the pitfalls of illiquid investments, such as private equity, which typically require a longer commitment and often come with higher fees and risks.\n\nThe executive order also mandates the Secretary of Labor to review fiduciary responsibilities regarding alternative investments, aiming to ease regulatory burdens that have hampered opportunities for retirement savers. With $12.2 trillion in defined-contribution plans, the inclusion of alternative assets could diversify and enhance returns, provided the selection is prudent and properly vetted by fiduciaries.\n\nAs industry leaders weigh in, opinions diverge on how these alternative assets will be integrated into retirement plans. Many anticipate they will be wrapped into managed accounts or target-date funds rather than being available as standalone options, reflecting a cautious approach to risk management.\n\nWhile the landscape is poised for transformation, participants are advised to proceed with caution. Experts are unanimous in suggesting that investors limit their exposure to alternative assets and remain vigilant about fees and the overall suitability of these investments within their portfolios.\n\nAs the roll-out of alternative asset options unfolds, stakeholders in retirement planning will be closely monitoring how these changes will materialize and impact the average investor's portfolio. The coming months may be critical in shaping the future of retirement investment strategies in the U.S.",

        "article_text": "By Dr. Jim Dahle, WCI Founder\n\nJosh Katzowitz, our content director, reads financial pornography. I've been trying to break him of that habit, but instead, he seems more successful in getting me to read it and, worse, write about it. The latest edition comes from an article on CBS News titled \u201cTrump wants your 401(k) to access crypto and private equity. Here's what to know.\u201d The article talks about an executive order President Trump signed on August 12 that makes it easier for your 401(k) and other employer-provided retirement plans to include options allowing employees to invest in cryptoassets and private equity funds. The executive order, titled Democratizing Access to Alternative Assets for 401(k) Investors, says:\n\n\u201cIt is the policy of the United States that every American preparing for retirement should have access to funds that include investments in alternative assets when the relevant plan fiduciary determines that such access provides an appropriate opportunity for plan participants and beneficiaries to enhance the net risk-adjusted returns on their retirement assets.\u201d\n\nThe order defines alternatives as:\n\nDirect and indirect private equity and debt\n\nPrivate real estate equity and debt\n\nDigital asset funds\n\nCommodities\n\nInfrastructure development projects\n\nAnnuities\n\nWhat could go wrong, right? Well, the main problem is that the majority of the investments in the assets above should probably be avoided by most Americans, whether or not they are available in their 401(k). Most Americans should be mostly investing in boring old index and index-like stock, bond, and real estate funds. Lots of investments in the categories listed above are investments designed to be sold, not bought.\n\nHow will the executive order provide access? It's going to loosen up regulations on fiduciaries that own companies and practices that offer 401(k)s. I'm not necessarily against that. I'm not even necessarily against allowing employees access to alternative investments. I mean, we put the WCI 401(k) in place. Not only does it allow Mega Backdoor Roth contributions, but it basically allows all employees to invest in just about anything they can buy at Fidelity, including the private real estate debt funds Katie and I invest in, within the 401(k). But loosening fiduciary duties might not be the best thing for every company and every employee in the country.\n\nThe 3 Questions\n\nAssuming your 401(k) takes advantage of this new executive order and offers more private investments, there are three issues at hand.\n\nThe first is whether you should invest in the asset class at all. Maybe that's where we should spend most of our time, but unfortunately, each of these asset classes under discussion is worthy of not just a single blog post, but a series of blog posts.\n\nThe second question is whether the investment vehicle chosen by the 401(k) investment committee is the right way to invest in this asset class.\n\nThe final question is a question of asset location, i.e., is your 401(k) the right place to put this particular investment as opposed to another account like a Roth IRA or a taxable account, assuming you also have access to those.\n\nShould You Invest?\n\nThe fun part about investing is that there are no \u201ccalled strikes.\u201d You don't have to invest in everything to be successful. Katie and I have chosen to invest in three types of producing assets: stocks, bonds, and real estate. We find them relatively easy to understand, see long-term profitable track records, and find it so simple to manage a portfolio with these assets that we don't need to hire professional help to do it. Of that long list of what is now going to be allowed in 401(k)s, the only one we're already doing is private real estate. We don't invest in cryptoassets, commodities, private equity (well, outside of the businesses we control), or annuities. And I have no idea how to invest in \u201cinfrastructure.\u201d We don't have to invest in that stuff (including private real estate), and you don't either. It's perfectly acceptable to just avoid it all completely.\n\nWe find speculative assets particularly odious. For us, speculative means the return is completely dependent on getting someone else to pay you more for the asset than you paid for it. It is a non-producing asset. It doesn't produce earnings, interest, or rents. You might even have to pay taxes on it or to insure it and protect it. Examples include empty land, currencies (including cryptocurrencies), precious metals, collectibles, and commodities. That doesn't mean you can't get a good return out of a speculative asset. Just imagine buying Bitcoin in 2011, the first time I warned you about it. If you had held that investment from 2011 until today, you would have made a killing. But the same caution I gave out then, I give again today: limit the amount of your portfolio invested in speculative assets to a single-digit percentage of your portfolio.\n\nA particularly important issue to understand about private investments is that they tend to be illiquid. They're not publicly traded. That means there is no market for them anywhere comparable to the public stock and bond markets. You can't just go to cash tomorrow because you want to or because you're quitting a job and rolling over your 401(k). You might not have the ability to get your money back for months or even years. Now, I'm perfectly fine giving up some of my liquidity so long as I am paid to do so. But if you're not, you'd better avoid private investments in your 401(k). I'm sure a lot of these funds will do what they can to give you some liquidity so they can get access to the $13 trillion in defined contribution assets, but that will surely come with some additional fees to whoever is providing that liquidity. In short, you're giving up at least some of that illiquidity premium.\n\n\u201cPrivate equity\u201d is the latest hot investing topic. The argument is that you get higher returns and lower volatility than you would with publicly traded investments. A neighbor of mine runs a private equity fund. He does think higher returns are available (although far from automatic), but he readily admits the lower volatility is mostly just hiding the volatility. The wonderful thing about public equity is that we've already figured out the best way to invest in it, and that way is super cheap and super simple. It's called \u201cindex funds.\u201d\n\nBasically, investing is free, so long as you invest in publicly traded stocks. It's no surprise then that those trying to make money by selling investments must now go into some other asset class to make it. Voila\u2014private equity! Now, investing is complicated again, and you need a pro to show you the right way to do it. And that pro must be paid. There are no private equity index funds. That doesn't mean you shouldn't invest in them, but you're basically going back to the pre-1975 investing world where you have to spend forever figuring out who to invest with; monitor them carefully; and then pay them most, or all, of the excess return they get for you in the form of fees.\n\nTread carefully in private investments. Every one of them is unique and must be evaluated on its own merits. It's perfectly OK to ignore all of them.\n\nMore information here:\n\nWhy I Am Winning with Crypto\n\nThe Emotions Behind Short-Term Trading: The Other 5% of Your Money\n\nInvestment Committee Considerations\n\nI serve on two 401(k) investment committees, one for my physician partnership and one for the WCI 401(k). Our primary consideration in those meetings is our fiduciary duty to the other employees. But I'm really not impressed with the abilities of most 401(k) committees to select winning actively managed investments for their plans. They never really figured out how to do it with publicly traded stocks, so I have little faith they'll pull it off with digital assets and private equity.\n\nJust because it's \u201cprivate equity\u201d and it's in your 401(k) doesn't mean you should buy it. You can't just rely on the investment committee's due diligence. You have to do your own. Maybe you get lucky and you get a really good PE investment in your 401(k), but don't count on it.\n\nOne alternative that investment committees have is to let the employees invest in mostly anything they want and have them sign a waiver releasing the committee from being liable for their stupidity. That's pretty much the approach we took at WCI. But we're also running a financial literacy business where most of our employees have advanced degrees and know more about investing than most of those who call themselves financial advisors. We might be a little bit of an exception. But even my physician partnership 401(k) at Schwab offers the \u201cPCRA\u201d option, which is basically just a brokerage window. Don't like the mutual funds the committee chose? Fine, go put it all in Nvidia and Tesla. But don't try to sue the company for your risky decisions.\n\nThe Asset Location Decision\n\nOnce you've decided to invest in an alternative asset class and found the investment vehicle for it, you're still left with the asset location decision. Is your 401(k) really the place for this asset class and this investment in particular? With crypto, the answer is almost surely not if you have any taxable money anywhere. Crypto may be the most tax-efficient asset class out there. Bitcoin does not pay any dividends, it gets capital gains tax treatment, and you don't even have to worry about a wash sale rule when tax-loss harvesting. You can buy it back 10 seconds later and harvest any loss you get. If I owned any, it would be the first asset class I put in my taxable account, not the last.\n\nOther alternative asset classes may not be as tax-efficient, but private equity real estate is more tax-efficient than most of my asset classes since the income tends to be shielded by depreciation. My point is that your 401(k) may not be the best place for this investment anyway. If all of your investment money is in tax-deferred accounts and you want to invest in alternatives, this executive order might matter more to you than it does to me. But that's not the case for most white coat investors.\n\nMore information here:\n\nA Moderate-Income Physician\u2019s Approach to Alternative Investments\n\nShould Doctors Be Angel Investing?\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nDon't expect to see any change in your 401(k) for a year or two. It will take time for the SEC, investing companies, and your 401(k) investment committee to act on it. Even if you do see a change, you can probably ignore it. If you want to invest in alternatives, tread carefully and limit them to a reasonable percentage of your portfolio. A portfolio composed entirely of boring publicly traded investments is completely reasonable and, if funded adequately, it should allow you to reach all of your financial goals.\n\nWhat do you think? Does your 401(k) offer any alternative investments? Would you use them even if it did? Why or why not? If you're investing in private equity, how are you doing so?",

        "article_text": "Presidential Actions DEMOCRATIZING ACCESS TO ALTERNATIVE ASSETS FOR 401(K) INVESTORS\n\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:\n\nSection 1. Purpose. Many wealthy Americans, and Government workers who participate in public pension plans, can invest in, or are the beneficiaries of investment in, a number of alternative assets. Yet, while more than 90 million Americans participate in employer-sponsored defined-contribution plans, the vast majority of these investors do not have the opportunity to participate, either directly or through their retirement plans, in the potential growth and diversification opportunities associated with alternative asset investments.\n\nFiduciaries of 401(k) and other defined-contribution retirement plans must carefully vet and consider all aspects of private offerings, including investment managers\u2019 capabilities, experiences, and effectiveness managing alternative asset investments. They do so to protect the Americans whose retirement accounts they administer and for whom they have fiduciary duties to invest safely and prudently.\n\nDuring my first term, my Administration issued a 2020 information letter, recognizing that prudent Federal action could encourage the proliferation of investment strategies under which a portion of retirement plan participants\u2019 interests are allocated to alternative assets, as is the case for institutional investors.\n\nBurdensome lawsuits that seek to challenge reasonable decisions by loyal, regulated fiduciaries, and stifling Department of Labor guidance issued since my first term, however, have denied millions of Americans opportunities to benefit from investment in alternative assets. Such assets are an increasingly large portion of the portfolios of public pension and defined-benefit retirement plans and offer competitive returns along with diversification opportunities.\n\nA combination of regulatory overreach and encouragement of lawsuits filed by opportunistic trial lawyers has stifled investment innovation and largely relegated 401(k) and other defined-contribution retirement plan participants to asset classes whose returns lack the very same long-term net benefits allowed for and achieved by public pension plans and other institutional investors.\n\nMy Administration will relieve the regulatory burdens and litigation risk that impede American workers\u2019 retirement accounts from achieving the competitive returns and asset diversification necessary to secure a dignified, comfortable retirement.\n\nSec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States that every American preparing for retirement should have access to funds that include investments in alternative assets when the relevant plan fiduciary determines that such access provides an appropriate opportunity for plan participants and beneficiaries to enhance the net risk-adjusted returns on their retirement assets.\n\nSec. 3. Democratizing Access to Alternative Assets. (a) For purposes of this order, the term \u201calternative assets\u201d means:\n\n(i) private market investments, including direct and indirect interests in equity, debt, or other financial instruments that are not traded on public exchanges, including those where the managers of such investments, if applicable, seek to take an active role in the management of such companies;\n\n(ii) direct and indirect interests in real estate, including debt instruments secured by direct or indirect interests in real estate;\n\n(iii) holdings in actively managed investment vehicles that are investing in digital assets;\n\n(iv) direct and indirect investments in commodities;\n\n(v) direct and indirect interests in projects financing infrastructure development; and\n\n(vi) lifetime income investment strategies including longevity risk-sharing pools.\n\n(b) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Labor (Secretary) shall reexamine the Department of Labor\u2019s past and present guidance regarding a fiduciary\u2019s duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA) (29 U.S.C. 1104), in connection with making available to participants an asset allocation fund that includes investments in alternative assets. When conducting this reexamination, the Secretary shall consider whether to rescind the Department of Labor\u2019s December 21, 2021, Supplemental Private Equity Statement.\n\n(c) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary shall further, as the Secretary deems appropriate and consistent with applicable law, seek to clarify the Department of Labor\u2019s position on alternative assets and the appropriate fiduciary process associated with offering asset allocation funds containing investments in alternative assets under ERISA. Such clarification must aim to identify the criteria that fiduciaries should use to prudently balance potentially higher expenses against the objectives of seeking greater long-term net returns and broader diversification of investments. The Secretary shall also propose rules, regulations, or guidance, as the Secretary deems appropriate, that clarify the duties that a fiduciary owes to plan participants under ERISA when deciding whether to make available to plan participants an asset allocation fund that includes investments in alternative assets, which rules, regulations, and guidance may include appropriately calibrated safe harbors. In carrying out the directives in this section to further the policy set forth in this order, the Secretary shall prioritize actions that may curb ERISA litigation that constrains fiduciaries\u2019 ability to apply their best judgment in offering investment opportunities to relevant plan participants.\n\n(d) In carrying out the directives in this section, the Secretary shall, as appropriate, consult with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and other Federal regulators as necessary to carry out the policy objectives of this order, including as to parallel regulatory changes that may be incorporated by such other Federal regulators.\n\n(e) The SEC shall, in consultation with the Secretary, consider ways to facilitate access to investments in alternative assets by participants in participant-directed defined-contribution retirement savings plans. Such facilitation may include, but not be limited to, consideration of revisions to existing SEC regulations and guidance relating to accredited investor and qualified purchaser status, to accomplish the policy objectives of this order.\n\nSec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\n(d) The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the Department of Labor.\n\nDONALD J.

The EO attributes this gap to regulatory overreach, restrictive US Department of Labor (DOL) guidance, and litigation risks that have discouraged plan fiduciaries from offering alternative asset options.\n\nKey Policy Objectives\n\nThe order establishes as federal policy that all Americans preparing for retirement should have access to funds that include alternative asset investments, provided that plan fiduciaries determine such access is appropriate for enhancing net risk-adjusted returns on and diversification of participant plan assets.\n\nAction Items and Regulatory Review\n\nReexamination of Fiduciary Duties: Within 180 days of the EO, the US Secretary of Labor must review and potentially revise existing DOL guidance regarding fiduciary duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) as they pertain to the offering of alternative asset investments.

Clarification and Safe Harbors: The Secretary is further tasked with clarifying the DOL\u2019s position on alternative assets and the fiduciary process for offering asset allocation funds containing alternative assets.

SEC Review: The SEC is instructed to consider regulatory revisions that would facilitate access to alternative assets for participants in defined-contribution plans, including potential changes to accredited investor and qualified purchaser definitions.\n\nAdditional Department of Labor Developments\n\nOn August 12, just days after the EO was issued, the DOL rescinded a December 21, 2021, Supplemental Private Equity Statement issued under the Biden Administration, which cautioned fiduciaries of 401(k) retirement plans from including alternative assets. The 2021 statement asserted that most plan fiduciaries were \u201cnot likely suited to evaluate the use of PE investments in designated alternatives in individual account plans.\u201d This guidance was seen as undermining a prior information letter from June 3, 2020, that had been more open to the inclusion of alternative assets.\n\nIn connection with the rescission, the DOL remarked that the previous guidance departed from the Department\u2019s traditional, neutral, and principles-based approach to fiduciary investment decisions under ERISA. The DOL emphasized that fiduciaries should evaluate all investment options based on relevant facts and circumstances, without the Department singling out specific asset classes for special scrutiny.\n\nNext Steps\n\nThis EO signals a significant policy shift toward access to alternative asset classes for retirement savers, with the potential to reshape the investment landscape for defined-contribution plans and the fiduciary process for selecting plan investments. Plan sponsors, fiduciaries, and asset managers should monitor forthcoming regulatory developments from the DOL and the SEC as the implementation process unfolds.",

        "article_text": "President Donald Trump 's new executive order paves the way to bring alternative assets into 401(k)s, but what that will eventually look like \u2014 and how complicated it may be \u2014 remains to be seen. The order, signed by the president on Thursday , directs the Secretary of Labor to reexamine fiduciary guidance on alternative investments \u2014 such as private equity, private credit and cryptocurrencies \u2014 in 401(k) and other defined-contribution plans. Those plans are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA. Adding alternative assets can be a complex endeavor for 401(k) plan sponsors, thanks to issues including liquidity, transparency and fees. However, investors will have some time before the offerings become available. The employer-sponsored retirement plans move slowly, even when things aren't complicated, said Jason Kephart, senior principal for multi-asset strategy ratings at Morningstar. \"We're still very 'day one' for plan sponsors to get comfortable, to get the approval. It's going to take many quarters,\" he said. \"There's still a very big question if plan sponsors will actually get comfortable enough to make these an option.\" Some $12.2 trillion was held in defined contributions plans, which include 401(k)s and 403(b) plans, as of the end of the first quarter, according to the Investment Company Institute . About $8.7 trillion of that is in 401(k)s. One size doesn't always fit Bonnie Treichel, an attorney who specializes in ERISA, believes it is inevitable that assets such as private equity, private credit, hedge funds, real estate and cryptocurrencies are coming to the defined contribution market. The onus is on the plan fiduciaries, both financial advisors and the plan sponsors, to know how to vet the options and make them available to participants, she said. They also aren't obligated to offer the investments at all, she noted. \"The plan sponsors' job is to offer an investment lineup that is in the best interest of the plan and its participants, and that meets the needs of those participants,\" said Treichel, founder of Endeavor Retirement. \"It's not a one-size-fits all when it comes to retirement plans.\" Treichel doesn't see alternative assets becoming available as a standalone investment option in a 401(k), at least just yet. \"They're probably going to be as part of a managed account. They're going to be as part of a target date fund,\" she said. \"It's not going to be the participant can go put 20% of their total plan assets into a hedge fund. That hedge fund is going to be within a target date fund, so a participant is not necessarily choosing how much they allocate to a hedge fund or private credit.\" Part of the whole Prime Capital Financial's Jania Stout, president of the firm's retirement and wellness businesses, also anticipates the options are likely to be inside a target date fund, with a small percentage allocated to private markets, or managed accounts. The latter would have someone managing the pool of assets and having fiduciary oversight of the assets, she noted. \"I believe plan sponsors can feel a lot more comfortable doing it that way, than just having it as another option stand alone in their retirement plan,\" she said. \"I don't think we're there yet.\" Morningstar's Kephart believes that first offering the investments in managed accounts, which investors often have to opt into, will make plan sponsors more comfortable, he said. \"I think the product development for the 401(k) plan, it's going to happen in collective investment trusts,\" he said. Collective investment trusts are pooled investment vehicles available to individual investors only through retirement plans. They will likely have to use cash, perhaps upwards of 20%, to manage the illiquidity of private assets, he said. \"That's also going to water down your private market exposure,\" he said. \"It brings the question of \u2014 at the end of the day, is it worth it if you have to take all these extra steps to make it fit?\" Higher fees Adding exposure to alternative assets could also cost you more money. Fees are almost always higher on private assets, for instance, and they are not always clear. \"A lot of expense ratios do not have to include the expected incentive fee expense,\" Kephart pointed out. \"What we've seen in private market funds is the incentive fee expense is usually at least as high as the management fee, if not higher.\" For instance, a lot of index-based target-date funds have expense ratios of 0.10% or lower, he said. Private market funds start at around a 1% management fee, plus the incentive fee, he added. If a plan ultimately offers some form of alternative asset allocation and investors aren't interested, they can talk to the advisors associated with the plan about other investment options, Treichel said. Typically plan participants can choose between something like a target -date fund, passive strategies, active options and perhaps a brokerage window, she said. Stout agrees there will always be a choice. \"Most prudent plan sponsors allow people to opt out of it,\" she said. \"The question will be \u2014 is it going to be an opt in or an opt out? And that's what committees have to decide when they're evaluating this at their fiduciary committee meetings.\" Encouraging guardrails Certified financial planner Chuck Failla, founder of Sovereign Financial Group, thinks 401(k)s should have some type of guardrails in place to ensure those investing in private markets are accredited investors, which means they have a net worth of at least $1 million. \"If you don't have a $1 million liquid, you should probably stay away from alts until you have some more liquidity backed up,\" said Failla, who offers private market access to his mass affluent clients through a fund. Investors should also consider how the assets are ultimately integrated. For instance, if plan sponsors try to limit the risks that inherently come with investing in the space, it could ultimately affect the investments' returns, said Tony Roth, chief investment officer for Wilmington Trust Investment Advisors. In addition, trying to manage the liquidity issue by packing private assets in something like an interval fund, which provides limited liquidity, may also restrict returns, he added. \"One of the reasons that private market' return is so much better is because you get compensated by giving your money away for an extended period of time where you can't get it back,\" Roth explained. That said, alternative assets could help provide diversification that is missing from the market these days, he said. The major indexes are tilted toward larger-cap companies and many companies are staying private for longer \u2014 dwindling the pool of small- and mid-cap companies, he added. \"There's a lot more opportunity for alpha or outsized performance in private markets,\" Roth said. \"You have to end up trusting the right people to make those investments for you, because it can go in the wrong direction as well.\"",
